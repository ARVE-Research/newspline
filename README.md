# newspline
New mean-preserving spline interpolation scheme for interpolating one-dimensional data series into smaller time step, with additional options to impose lower, upper and/or percentage limit to interpolated values.

Makefile included to generate the executable ./newspline for interpolating a sample 36 months of mean temperature into daily data.
